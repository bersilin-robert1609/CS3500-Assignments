# Operating Systems - LAB 7
## Disk Scheduler

Note: The code is written in C++ and compiled using g++ compiler.

### Problem: Write a program to simulate the disk scheduling algorithms FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, CSCAN, LOOK, CLOOK.

To run the file:
1. To compile the file: 
```sh
make

./main -h <head_position> -a <algorithm>
```
### The arguments are: 

1. -h <head_position> : The head position of the disk
The limits are : 0 - 4999

2. -a <algorithm> : The algorithm (an integer from 1-6) to be used for scheduling. 

### The options are:
    1. FCFS
    2. SSTF
    3. SCAN
    4. CSCAN
    5. LOOK
    6. CLOOK

Note : 

1. The default values for head_position is 2000 and algorithm is 1 (FCFS)
        2. These arguments are optional. If not provided, the default values will be used.

2. To clean the files:
    make clean

3. To run the file manually:

```sh
g++ disk-scheduler.cpp -o main
./main -h <head_position> -a <algorithm>
```

I have attached the sample_outputs.txt file for reference.
This was generated using the shell script "create_table.sh" which is in the helper folder.

To run the script:
```sh
cp ./helper/create_table.sh .
bash create_table.sh
```

This recreates the sample_outputs.txt file
