## File Systems Simulator

Note: The code is written in C++ and compiled using g++ compiler.

### Problem: The task is to simulate a file-system

To run the file:
1. To compile the file: 
```sh
make
./main
```

2. To clean the files:
```sh
make clean
```

3. To run the file manually:
```sh
g++ file-system.cpp -o <output_file_name>
./<output_file_name>
```
